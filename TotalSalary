Total Salary
Send Feedback
Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -
    totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf
where :
hra   = 20% of basic
da    = 50% of basic
allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
pf    = 11% of basic.
Round off the total salary and then print the integral part only.
Note: Try finding out a function on the internet to do so

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int Basic_Salary = sc.nextInt();
    char Grade = sc.next().charAt(0);
    char allow = Character.toUpperCase(Grade);
    double hra = 0.2 * Basic_Salary;
    double da = 0.5 * Basic_Salary;
    double pf = 0.11 * Basic_Salary;
    if (allow == 'A') {
      System.out.print(Math.round(Basic_Salary + hra + da + 1700 - pf));
    } else if (allow == 'B') {
      System.out.print(Math.round(Basic_Salary + hra + da + 1500 - pf));
    } else {
      System.out.print(Math.round(Basic_Salary + hra + da + 1300 - pf));
    }
